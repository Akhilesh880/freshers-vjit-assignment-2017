Hi
My project is based on APPLICATION basis.
Here two cases are possible,
case 1:
Customer having our restaurant application and booking the table for him at a specified slot with a small amount which is refundable,even he can order and at the same time.
Case 2:
Customer not having the application, he comes to the restaurant the host checks or table if available he will direct them to the table if not available directs to the waiting room.
At the table manager comes with menu the customer orders the food.
Manager gives the order to Chef.
Meanwhile manager Checks weather the customer has smart phone.
If yes he advices them for installation of their restaurant application for happy dinning without waiting for table allotment.
Server gets the food from the chef.
After dinning manager sends the bill.
Customer pays the bill.
Host wishes "THANK YOU SIR".
